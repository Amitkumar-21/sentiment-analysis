# üìù Text Classification using NLP & ML

This project implements a **sentiment classification pipeline** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. It focuses on text preprocessing, feature extraction, and evaluating multiple classifiers to determine the most effective model.

---

## üîπ Features
- Text preprocessing with **NLTK & TextBlob** (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).
- Feature extraction using **Bag-of-Words** and **TF-IDF Vectorization**.
- Dataset balancing with **SMOTE**.
- Trained and compared multiple ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Naive Bayes
- Performance evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
- Hyperparameter tuning with **GridSearchCV**.

## Outcome
An end-to-end **text classification pipeline** for sentiment analysis was built and tested with multiple machine learning algorithms.  
The comparison helps identify the best-performing model for real-world text data.
